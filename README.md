Shopping cart for ezyVet


I could have implemented this cart slightly differently, where the product list refreshes asyncronously however I decieded to prove that the session persists, I would use the classic method of reloading the page.

Make you you place this in a place where PHP can interpret the code (I used XAMP, however I am sure that you are working in an IDE)

I found the instructions slightly unclear in terms of the shopping cart - did we have to make a "shop" as well? I did anyways (but dont look at that!)

Have a great day :)
